    "mainEntity": [
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is digital privacy and why does it matter?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Digital privacy refers to your right to control what personal information is collected about you online, how it is used, and who can access it. It matters because data breaches, identity theft, and surveillance can lead to financial loss, reputation damage, employment discrimination, and loss of personal autonomy."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a credit privacy file?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A credit privacy file is a separate credit profile registered with the IRS that provides legal standing in commerce independent from your Social Security Number credit history. This allows individuals to establish a distinct financial identity for business and personal transactions."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do data brokers collect my personal information?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Data brokers collect information from public records, social media, loyalty programs, credit card transactions, app usage, web tracking cookies, and purchased datasets. Companies like Acxiom maintain over 1,500 data points on 700 million U.S. consumers."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the difference between privacy and anonymity?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Privacy is about controlling who knows what about you and under what circumstances. Anonymity is about conducting activities without linking them to your real identity. You can be private without being anonymous, and anonymous without being private."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How can I protect myself from identity theft?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Protect yourself by using strong unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, freezing your credit with all three bureaus, monitoring your credit reports, being cautious with phishing attempts, using a VPN on public WiFi, and limiting personal information shared online."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is GDPR and does it apply to me?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the EU's privacy law that grants rights including data access, deletion, and portability. It applies to EU residents and any company serving EU customers, regardless of where that company is located."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What rights do I have under CCPA?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Under California's CCPA/CPRA, you have the right to know what data is collected, request deletion, opt out of data sales, correct inaccurate information, and limit use of sensitive data. These rights apply to California residents regardless of where the company is based."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does Google track me?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Google tracks you through search queries, Gmail content, YouTube viewing history, location data from Android and Maps, Chrome browsing history, voice commands to Assistant, and advertising network cookies across 75% of top websites."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a VPN and should I use one?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, protecting you from surveillance on public networks. You should use one when on public WiFi, accessing sensitive accounts, or when you want to prevent your ISP from tracking your browsing."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do smart home devices compromise privacy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Smart home devices like Alexa, Google Home, smart TVs, and Ring cameras continuously collect audio, video, and behavioral data. This data can be accessed by the manufacturer, shared with third parties, subpoenaed by law enforcement, or exposed in data breaches."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is facial recognition and how is it used?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Facial recognition uses AI to identify individuals from images or video.

Clearview AI has scraped over 30 billion faces."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How can I opt out of data broker databases?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "You can opt out by submitting removal requests to each data broker individually. Major brokers include Acxiom, Experian, LexisNexis, Spokeo, and WhitePages. Services like DeleteMe and Privacy Duck automate this process for a fee."}},

Facebook maintains shadow profiles on non-users."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is my health data protected by HIPAA?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HIPAA only protects health data held by covered entities like hospitals and insurers. Health apps, fitness trackers, DNA testing services, and period-tracking apps are generally not covered by HIPAA and can share your data freely."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can my employer monitor my work computer?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, employers can legally monitor company devices including emails, keystrokes, screen activity, file access, and web browsing.

        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is end-to-end encryption?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "End-to-end encryption ensures only you and your intended recipient can read messages - not the platform, hackers, or government. Apps with E2E encryption include Signal, WhatsApp (for messages), and iMessage. It protects against interception."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do credit bureaus collect my data?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Credit bureaus receive data from lenders, credit card companies, collection agencies, and public records. They track payment history, credit utilization, account ages, inquiries, and public records like bankruptcies. This data follows you throughout your life."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a credit freeze and how do I get one?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from being opened in your name by blocking access to your credit report. It is free to place and lift at Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You should freeze your credit proactively, not just after a breach."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does location tracking work on my phone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Your phone tracks location via GPS, cell tower triangulation, WiFi network detection, and Bluetooth beacons. This data is accessed by apps, sold to data brokers, used for advertising, and can be subpoenaed by law enforcement."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are cookies and tracking pixels?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cookies are small files websites store on your device to track behavior. Tracking pixels are invisible images that report when emails are opened or pages viewed. Both enable cross-site tracking and targeted advertising profiles."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How can I make my browser more private?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Use Firefox or Brave instead of Chrome. Install uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger extensions. Enable strict tracking protection. Use a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo. Clear cookies regularly or use containers to isolate sessions."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the privacy paradox?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The privacy paradox describes how people claim to value privacy highly but routinely share personal information for minor conveniences. It is explained by cognitive load, present bias (immediate benefits vs future risks), and information asymmetry."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I request my data from a company?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Submit a data subject access request (DSAR) citing GDPR Article 15 or CCPA rights. Companies must respond within 30-45 days. You can request what data they have, how it is used, who it was shared with, and request deletion."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is browser fingerprinting?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Browser fingerprinting identifies you without cookies by collecting unique combinations of browser settings, installed fonts, screen resolution, plugins, and hardware. It is harder to block than cookies and can track you across sessions."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are password managers safe to use?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, reputable password managers like 1Password, Bitwarden, and Dashlane are much safer than reusing passwords. They use strong encryption and enable unique complex passwords for every site. Use one with a strong master password and 2FA."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is two-factor authentication and why use it?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires something you know (password) plus something you have (phone or key). It prevents account takeover even if your password is compromised. Use authenticator apps or hardware keys rather than SMS codes."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I know if my data was in a breach?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Check HaveIBeenPwned.com with your email addresses.

        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What privacy settings should I change on my phone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Disable ad tracking (Limit Ad Tracking on iOS, Opt Out of Ads Personalization on Android). Review app permissions for location, camera, microphone. Disable personalized ads. Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth scanning. Limit lock screen notifications."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a credit privacy file registered with the IRS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A credit privacy file registered with the IRS is a legitimate alternative financial identity that provides legal standing in commerce separate from your SSN credit profile. This allows you to conduct business and personal transactions with a distinct credit history."}}

        <p>Digital privacy is your fundamental right to control what personal information is collected about you online, how it is used, and who can access it. Unlike physical privacy, digital privacy extends across borders and persists indefinitely in databases around the world.</p>

        <h3>The Four Pillars of Digital Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Privacy:</strong> Control over what data is collected about you</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Privacy:</strong> Protection of your messages and conversations</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Privacy:</strong> Security of your financial transactions and history</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Privacy:</strong> Protection of your personal identifiers</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>What is digital privacy and why does it matter?</h3>
                <p>Digital privacy refers to your right to control what personal information is collected about you online, how it is used, and who can access it. It matters because data breaches, identity theft, and surveillance can lead to financial loss, reputation damage, employment discrimination, and loss of personal autonomy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>What is a credit privacy file?</h3>
                <p>A credit privacy file is a separate credit profile registered with the IRS that provides legal standing in commerce independent from your Social Security Number credit history. This allows individuals to establish a distinct financial identity for business and personal transactions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>How do data brokers collect my personal information?</h3>
                <p>Data brokers collect information from public records, social media, loyalty programs, credit card transactions, app usage, web tracking cookies, and purchased datasets. Companies like Acxiom maintain over 1,500 data points on 700 million U.S. consumers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>How can I protect myself from identity theft?</h3>
                <p>Protect yourself by using strong unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, freezing your credit with all three bureaus, monitoring your credit reports, being cautious with phishing attempts, using a VPN on public WiFi, and limiting personal information shared online.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>What is a VPN and should I use one?</h3>
                <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, protecting you from surveillance on public networks. You should use one when on public WiFi, accessing sensitive accounts, or when you want to prevent your ISP from tracking your browsing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cpn-faq-item">
                <h3>What is a credit privacy file registered with the IRS?</h3>
                <p>A credit privacy file registered with the IRS is a legitimate alternative financial identity that provides legal standing in commerce separate from your SSN credit profile. This allows you to conduct business and personal transactions with a distinct credit history.</p>
